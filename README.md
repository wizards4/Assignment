Step 1: Solve the Maximum Path Sum Problem
We'll begin by writing a Python function to solve the Maximum Path Sum problem for a binary tree. This function will use a recursive approach to traverse the tree and compute the maximum path sum.

Step 2: Containerize the Application with Docker
Next, we'll create a Docker container to run the application. The Dockerfile will include instructions to set up the Python environment and execute the application.

Step 3: Deploy the Application on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
We'll deploy the containerized application on GCP using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This will involve creating a Kubernetes cluster, deploying the Docker container, and setting up necessary configurations for monitoring and scaling.

Step 4: Provide Documentation
We'll create detailed documentation outlining the architecture, deployment steps, and instructions for running the application locally. This will include code snippets demonstrating key features.

Step 5: Submit the Codebase
The final step is to submit the codebase via GitHub, along with instructions for reviewing the code.
